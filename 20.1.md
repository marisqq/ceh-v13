Perfect — we will now do **MODULE 20: CRYPTOGRAPHY**  
**FROM PAGE 1, STEP-BY-STEP, NOTHING SKIPPED**, exactly aligned with the **EC-Council CEHv13 PDF** you uploaded .

I will proceed **sequentially**, **exam-optimized**, and **concept-safe for a first-time learner**.

This reply covers **Module 20 → Learning Objectives + Objective 01 (FOUNDATIONS)** only.  
We will continue with **Objective 02** in the _next_ reply.

# MODULE 20 — CRYPTOGRAPHY (CEHv13)

SOURCE: _CEHv13 – Module 20 – Cryptography_

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES (EXAM-MANDATORY)

You must be able to:

|#|Learning Objective|
|---|---|
|01|Explain cryptography concepts|
|02|Understand different encryption algorithms|
|03|Use different cryptography tools|
|04|Apply applications of cryptography|
|05|Describe cryptography attacks|
|06|Use cryptanalysis tools|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Concepts → Algorithms → Tools → Applications → Attacks → Analysis**

# OBJECTIVE 01 — CRYPTOGRAPHY CONCEPTS AND ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS

---

## WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY (DEFINITION — EXACT CEH MEANING)

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Cryptography|The practice of concealing information by converting readable data into an unreadable format using encryption|

ORIGIN (EXAM FACT):

- Greek **kryptos** = hidden
    
- Greek **graphia** = writing
    

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Crypto = hidden writing**

---

## WHAT ENCRYPTION DOES

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|Encryption|Converts plaintext into ciphertext|
|Decryption|Converts ciphertext back into plaintext|

---

## CRYPTOGRAPHY PROCESS (LOGIC FLOW)

|Step|
|---|
|Plaintext|
|Encryption algorithm + key|
|Ciphertext|
|Transmission|
|Decryption algorithm + key|
|Plaintext|

EXAM TRAP:  
Encryption **does not remove data**, it only **transforms representation**.

---

## OBJECTIVES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY (VERY HIGH YIELD)

|Objective|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Confidentiality|Only authorized users can access information|
|Integrity|Data is not altered improperly|
|Authentication|Identity of sender/receiver is verified|
|Non-repudiation|Sender cannot deny sending the message|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**CIA + N**

EXAM TRAP:  
Encryption alone ≠ authentication or integrity.

---

## BASIC CRYPTOGRAPHY TERMINOLOGY

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Plaintext|Readable original data|
|Ciphertext|Encrypted unreadable data|
|Cipher|Algorithm used to encrypt/decrypt|
|Key|Secret value controlling encryption|
|Cryptanalysis|Breaking encryption|
|Cryptosystem|Algorithms + keys + protocols|

---

## TYPES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY (TOP-TIER EXAM CONTENT)

Cryptography is classified **based on number of keys used**.

---

### 1. SYMMETRIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|Keys used|Same key for encryption and decryption|
|Speed|Fast|
|Security issue|Key distribution problem|
|Also called|Secret-key cryptography|

LOGIC:

- Sender encrypts using shared secret key
    
- Receiver decrypts using same key
    

MEMORY HOOK:  
**One key → fast → hard to share**

---

### 2. ASYMMETRIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|Keys used|Public key + private key|
|Speed|Slow|
|Security|Solves key distribution problem|
|Also called|Public-key cryptography|

LOGIC:

- Public key encrypts
    
- Private key decrypts
    

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Two keys → secure sharing → slower**

---

## ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION MESSAGE FLOW (EXAM LOGIC)

|Step|Description|
|---|---|
|1|Sender finds receiver’s public key|
|2|Sender encrypts message using public key|
|3|Only receiver’s private key can decrypt|
|4|Ensures confidentiality|
|5|Digital signatures ensure authentication|

EXAM TRAP:  
Public key **cannot decrypt** what it encrypts.

---

## STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES (VERY COMMON MCQs)

### SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

|Strengths|Weaknesses|
|---|---|
|Fast|Key distribution problem|
|Efficient|Difficult key management|
|Less CPU usage|No authentication|

---

### ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

|Strengths|Weaknesses|
|---|---|
|Secure key exchange|Slow|
|Digital signatures|High CPU usage|
|Authentication|Not suitable for bulk data|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Symmetric = fast, Asymmetric = trust**

---

## GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO KEYS (GAK) — EXAM CONCEPT

|Term|Explanation|
|---|---|
|GAK|Government-mandated access to encryption keys|
|Purpose|Lawful interception|
|Method|Key escrow|
|Risk|Weakens privacy|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Key escrow = third party holds keys**

EXAM TRAP:  
Key escrow ≠ backdoor (but effect is similar).

---

## WHAT IS A CIPHER

|Definition|
|---|
|A cipher is a set of mathematical steps used to encrypt or decrypt data|

---

## TYPES OF CIPHERS

### CLASSICAL CIPHERS

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Substitution|Replace characters|
|Transposition|Rearrange characters|

EXAMPLES (EXAM):

- Caesar cipher
    
- Hill cipher
    
- Rail fence cipher
    

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Classical = letters**

---

### MODERN CIPHERS

Classified by:

#### A. TYPE OF KEY USED

|Type|
|---|
|Symmetric|
|Asymmetric|

#### B. TYPE OF INPUT DATA

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Block cipher|Encrypts fixed-size blocks|
|Stream cipher|Encrypts data bit-by-bit|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Block = chunks, Stream = flow**

---

## OBJECTIVE 01 — MEMORY CHECKLIST

You must remember:

- Cryptography goals = **CIA + N**
    
- Symmetric vs Asymmetric differences
    
- Encryption ≠ authentication
    
- Public key encrypts, private key decrypts
    
- Block vs Stream cipher difference
    
- Key distribution problem
    
- Key escrow definition
