# OBJECTIVE 03 — iOS THREATS AND ATTACKS

---

## iOS — CORE DEFINITION (EXAM)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|iOS|A closed-source mobile operating system developed by Apple for iPhone and iPad devices|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Closed-source ≠ immune**

---

## iOS SECURITY MODEL (EXAM FOUNDATION)

| Security Feature    | Description                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Code signing        | Only signed apps can run   |
| Sandboxing          | App isolation              |
| Secure Boot Chain   | Verifies integrity at boot |
| App Store vetting   | Apple review process       |
| Data Protection API | File-level encryption      |

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Sign → Sandbox → Secure Boot**

---

## WHY iOS IS STILL ATTACKED

|Reason|
|---|
|Jailbreaking bypasses controls|
|User trust in App Store|
|Zero-day exploits|
|Phishing and configuration abuse|

---

# iOS THREAT CATEGORIES (EXAM LIST)

|Category|
|---|
|Spyware|
|Malware|
|Trojans|
|Configuration profile abuse|
|Jailbreak-based attacks|
|Network-based attacks|

---

# JAILBREAKING — iOS (EXAM FAVORITE)

## JAILBREAKING — DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Jailbreaking|The process of removing iOS restrictions to gain root access|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Jailbreak = root access**

---

## JAILBREAKING — SECURITY IMPACT

|Impact|
|---|
|Disables code signing enforcement|
|Bypasses sandbox|
|Enables unauthorized apps|
|Breaks MDM enforcement|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**No sandbox, no trust**

---

## TYPES OF JAILBREAK (EXAM)

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Tethered|Requires computer at boot|
|Semi-tethered|Partial functionality|
|Untethered|Persistent jailbreak|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Un-tethered = persistent**

---

# iOS ATTACK VECTORS (MUST MEMORIZE)

---

## 1. MALICIOUS APPLICATIONS

|Aspect|Description|
|---|---|
|Source|Third-party stores|
|Delivery|Jailbroken devices|
|Impact|Data theft, spyware|

---

## 2. ENTERPRISE CERTIFICATE ABUSE

|Aspect|Description|
|---|---|
|What|Misuse of Apple enterprise certificates|
|Result|Unsigned apps installed|
|Impact|Malware distribution|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Enterprise cert = bypass gatekeeper**

---

## 3. CONFIGURATION PROFILE ATTACKS

|Aspect|Description|
|---|---|
|Method|Malicious profiles|
|Abuse|VPN, proxy, cert install|
|Result|Traffic interception|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Profile = silent control**

---

## 4. iOS SPYWARE

|Capability|
|---|
|Call recording|
|SMS monitoring|
|GPS tracking|
|App data theft|

---

## 5. NETWORK-BASED ATTACKS

|Attack|
|---|
|Rogue Wi-Fi|
|MITM|
|SSL stripping|
|Fake certificates|

---

# iOS APP VULNERABILITIES (EXAM TABLE)

|Vulnerability|
|---|
|Insecure local storage|
|Weak cryptography|
|Improper session handling|
|Hardcoded credentials|
|Insufficient certificate validation|

---

# iOS DATA STORAGE LOCATIONS (EXAM)

|Location|Risk|
|---|---|
|Keychain|Credential exposure|
|SQLite DB|Plaintext data|
|Plist files|Config leaks|
|Cache files|Sensitive remnants|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Keychain ≠ invincible**

---

# iOS COMMUNICATION THREATS

|Threat|
|---|
|Insecure TLS|
|Invalid cert acceptance|
|Proxy interception|

---

# iOS SECURITY TOOLS (CEH EXPECTS RECOGNITION)

|Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Cydia|Package manager (jailbroken)|
|Frida|Runtime instrumentation|
|Objection|iOS runtime analysis|
|iFunBox|File system access|
|Burp Suite|Traffic interception|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Frida = runtime control**

---

# iOS ATTACK CONSEQUENCES (EXAM TABLE)

|Impact|
|---|
|Data leakage|
|Privacy violations|
|Credential theft|
|Corporate compromise|

---

# ANDROID VS iOS — EXAM COMPARISON (VERY HIGH YIELD)

|Feature|Android|iOS|
|---|---|---|
|Source model|Open|Closed|
|Root access|Rooting|Jailbreaking|
|App vetting|Weak|Strong|
|Custom ROMs|Yes|No|
|Enterprise abuse|Less|More|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Android = open risk, iOS = controlled risk**

---

# OBJECTIVE 03 — EXAM MEMORY BLOCK

**iOS relies on code signing, sandboxing, and secure boot.  
Jailbreaking removes all protections.  
Attacks use malicious apps, enterprise certificates, and configuration profiles.  
Network interception and spyware remain key threats.**
