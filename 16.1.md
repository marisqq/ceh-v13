# OBJECTIVE 01 — SUMMARIZE WIRELESS CONCEPTS

---

## WIRELESS NETWORK — CORE DEFINITION

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Wireless Network|A network that uses radio-wave transmission to communicate at the physical layer instead of cables|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**No wires = radio waves**

---

## WIRELESS COMMUNICATION MEDIUM

|Component|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Transmission|Uses electromagnetic (EM) waves|
|Carrier|Air|
|Nature|Broadcast-based|

EXAM TRAP:  
Wireless = **broadcast**, not point-to-point.

---

## WIRELESS NETWORK TERMINOLOGY (VERY HIGH YIELD)

### GLOBAL SYSTEM FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS (GSM)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|GSM|Universal system for mobile data transmission worldwide|

---

### BANDWIDTH

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Bandwidth|Amount of data transferred per second|
|Unit|bits per second (bps)|

---

### ACCESS POINT (AP)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Access Point|Device that connects wireless devices to a wired network|
|Function|Acts as a switch or hub|

---

### BASIC SERVICE SET IDENTIFIER (BSSID)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|BSSID|MAC address of the access point|
|Role|Identifies a wireless access point|

EXAM TRAP:  
SSID ≠ BSSID

---

### HOTSPOT

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Hotspot|Public wireless access location|
|Examples|Airports, cafes, libraries|

---

### ASSOCIATION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Association|Process of connecting a wireless device to an AP|

---

## WIRELESS SIGNAL TECHNIQUES (VERY EXAM-IMPORTANT)

---

### ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY-DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (OFDM)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|OFDM|Digital modulation using multiple orthogonal subcarriers|
|Benefit|Higher data rates, reduced interference|

---

### MULTIPLE INPUT MULTIPLE OUTPUT (MIMO)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|MIMO|Uses multiple antennas|
|Benefit|Increased throughput and reliability|

---

### DIRECT-SEQUENCE SPREAD SPECTRUM (DSSS)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|DSSS|Spreads signal over wide frequency band|
|Purpose|Prevent jamming|

---

### FREQUENCY-HOPPING SPREAD SPECTRUM (FHSS)

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|FHSS|Rapid frequency changes|
|Purpose|Reduce interception|

---

MEMORY BLOCK (SIGNALS):  
**OFDM = speed, MIMO = power, DSSS = spread, FHSS = hop**

---

# WIRELESS NETWORKS — DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Wireless Network|Uses radio-wave transmission to communicate at the physical layer|

---

## ADVANTAGES OF WIRELESS NETWORKS

|Advantage|
|---|
