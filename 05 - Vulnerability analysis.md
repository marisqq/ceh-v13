Vulnerability classification:
	**Network misconfiguration** - insecure protocols, open ports and services, errors, weak encryption, host misconfigurations, open permissions, unsecured root accounts
	**Application flaws** - buffer overflows, memory leaks, resource exhaustion, integer overflows, null pointer, object dereference, DLL injection Race conditions, time to check/time to use, improper input handling, improper error handling, code signing weakness
	Poor patch management - unpatched servers, unpatched firmware, unpatched applications
	**Design flaws**
	**Third pary risks** - vendor management, system integration, lack of vendor support
	Supply-chain risks
	Outsourced code development - data storage, cloud based vs on-prem risks
	Default installations/Default configurations
	Operating system flaws
	Default passwords
	Zero day vulnerabilities
	Legacy platform vulns
	System sprawl/undocumented assets
	Improper certificate and key management
	
Vulnerability scoring systems and Databases
	Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
		

| Severity | Base score range |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| None     | 0.0              |
| Low      | 0.1-3.9          |
| Medium   | 4.0-6.9          |
| High     | 7.0-8.9          |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0         |

Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE)
	one identifier per vulnerability
	standardized description
	dictionary rather than database

National vulnerability database (NVD) (U.S. Goverment)
	Performs analysis on CVEs 

Common weakness enumeration (CWE)
	category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses

Vulnerability management lifecycle
	Pre-assessment phase- identify assets and create baseline
	Vulnerability assessment phase - vulnerability scan, vulnerability analysis
	Post assessment phase - risk assessment, remediation, verification, monitoring

Vulnerability research resources:
	Microsoft security response center (MSRC)
	Packet storm
Vulnerability scanning and analysis
	Active scanning: attacker interacts directly
	Passive scanning: identifies from exposed system information etc
		Tools:
		Nessus
		OpenVAS
		Qualys
		GFI LanGuard
Types of vuln scanning
	External scanning: firewalls, routers and servers
	Internal scanning: open ports, router and fw configs, 
	Host based scanning: particular network or server, assess systems to identify vulnerabilities
	Network based scanning: determines network security attacks, discover resources and map ports.
	Application scanning: transactional web applications, client-server applications
	Database scanning - mysql, mssql, oracle
	Wireless network scanning - determines vulnerabilities in organizations wireless networks
	Distributed scanning: synchronization across multiple locations
	Credentialed/authenticated scanning: scanner logs into target system
	non-credentialed/unauthenticated scanning: without creds
	Manual scanning: inspecting source code, manual config check, pen-tests
	Automated scanning: Nessus, qualys, GFI LanGuard
	Cloud based scanning: security of cloud infrastructure
	Mobile application scanning: mob apps and api's
	Physical security vulnerability scanning: physiscal assets
	IoT device vulnerability scanning: self explanatory

Vulnerability assessment tools:
	Product based solutions - installed on network
	Service based solutions - offered by third parties such as auditing or security consulting firms
Working of vuln scanning solutions:
	Locating nodes
	Service and OS discovery
	Testing for known vulnerabilities

Types of vuln assessment tools:
	host-based vulnerability assessment tools - for servers with various applications
	Depth assessment tools - uses set of vulnerability signatures to test resistance to known vulns
	application layer vuln assessment tools - trough internet or external router, firewall, webservewr
	Scope assessment tools - assessment of security by testing vulns in applications and operating system
	Active and passive tools - vuln check on network functions that consume resources on the network. passive scanners dont affect system resources and performance that much
	Loaction and data examination tools- network based scanner - remotely scan machines on network
	Agent based scanner - agents are installed on target machines
	Proxy scanner - can scan networks from any machine on network
	Cluster scanner - simultaneously perform two or more scans on different machines in the network

Choosing  a vuln assesement tool: 
	cabeble of scanning wide range of different vulnerrabilities
	database frequently updated etc.

Criteria of choosing vulnerability assessment tool:
	types of vulns being assesed
	tested capability of scanning
	efficient and accurate
	test run scheduling
	etc.
