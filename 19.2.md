# OBJECTIVE 02 — CLOUD COMPUTING THREATS AND ATTACKS

---

## WHY CLOUD IS A TARGET (EXAM LOGIC)

|Reason|
|---|
|Shared infrastructure|
|Internet exposure|
|Misconfiguration|
|Weak access control|
|API dependency|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Shared + exposed + misconfigured**

---

# CLOUD THREAT ACTORS (EXAM)

|Threat Actor|
|---|
|External attackers|
|Malicious insiders|
|Compromised accounts|
|Rogue administrators|

---

# CLOUD-SPECIFIC THREATS (MUST MEMORIZE)

---

## DATA BREACH

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Unauthorized access to sensitive data|
|Cause|Weak IAM, misconfiguration|
|Impact|Data loss, compliance violation|

EXAM TRAP:  
Cloud provider does NOT prevent data breaches automatically.

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Misconfig = data leak**

---

## DATA LOSS

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Permanent loss of data|
|Cause|Accidental deletion, ransomware|
|Impact|Business disruption|

---

## ACCOUNT OR SERVICE HIJACKING (VERY IMPORTANT)

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Attacker gains control of cloud account|
|Method|Phishing, credential theft|
|Impact|Full resource control|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Account = keys to kingdom**

---

## INSECURE INTERFACES AND APIs

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Poorly protected cloud APIs|
|Risk|Unauthorized access|
|Example|No authentication, weak tokens|

EXAM TRAP:  
APIs are the PRIMARY cloud attack surface.

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Cloud = API-driven**

---

## MISCONFIGURATION (TOP EXAM ITEM)

|Example|
|---|
|Public S3 buckets|
|Open storage|
|Default credentials|
|Over-permissive IAM|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Most cloud breaches = misconfig**

---

## MALICIOUS INSIDERS

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Who|Employees, contractors|
|Risk|Abuse of privileges|
|Impact|Data theft, sabotage|

---

## SHARED TECHNOLOGY VULNERABILITIES

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Weakness in shared components|
|Example|Hypervisor escape|
|Impact|Cross-tenant attacks|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Shared hardware = shared risk**

---

## DENIAL OF SERVICE (DoS/DDoS)

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Resource exhaustion|
|Target|Availability|
|Impact|Service outage|

EXAM TRAP:  
Auto-scaling does NOT stop DDoS completely.

---

## ABUSE AND NEFARIOUS USE OF CLOUD SERVICES

|Example|
|---|
|Crypto mining|
|Malware hosting|
|Botnet C2|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Cloud = attacker infrastructure**

---

# CLOUD ATTACK TYPES (DETAILED)

---

## CLOUD MALWARE INJECTION ATTACK

|Step|
|---|
|Attacker injects malicious service|
|Instance treated as legitimate|
|Malware executed|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Fake instance attack**

---

## METADATA SERVICE ATTACK

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Target|Cloud metadata API|
|Data|Credentials, tokens|
|Example|SSRF to metadata|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Metadata = secret store**

---

## VM ESCAPE ATTACK

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Break out of VM|
|Target|Hypervisor|
|Impact|Host compromise|

EXAM TRAP:  
Rare but critical.

---

## SIDE-CHANNEL ATTACKS

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|What|Information leakage|
|Method|Cache timing|
|Target|Co-resident VMs|

---

# CLOUD IDENTITY & ACCESS ATTACKS

---

## IAM MISUSE

|Issue|
|---|
|Overprivileged roles|
|No MFA|
|Long-lived credentials|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**IAM mistakes = breach**

---

## TOKEN THEFT

|Method|
|---|
|XSS|
|Malware|
|SSRF|

---

# CLOUD ATTACK FLOW (EXAM LOGIC)

1. Recon cloud assets
    
2. Identify misconfiguration
    
3. Exploit IAM or API
    
4. Escalate privileges
    
5. Persist access
    

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Recon → Misconfig → IAM → Control**

---

# COMMON CLOUD ATTACK TOOLS (EXAM)

|Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|
|ScoutSuite|Cloud security auditing|
|Prowler|AWS security assessment|
|Pacu|AWS exploitation|
|CloudSploit|Misconfiguration scanning|
|Metasploit|Cloud exploitation|

---

# EXAM TRAPS (VERY IMPORTANT)

|Trap|Correct Understanding|
|---|---|
|Cloud is secure by default|False|
|Provider handles all security|False|
|Encryption prevents breaches|False|
|No need for monitoring|False|

---

# OBJECTIVE 02 — EXAM MEMORY BLOCK

**Cloud threats primarily arise from misconfiguration, weak IAM, and insecure APIs.  
Account hijacking leads to full compromise.  
Most attacks exploit configuration errors rather than vulnerabilities.  
Shared infrastructure introduces unique risks.**

|Objective|Status|
|---|---|
|Cloud threats|COMPLETE|
|Attack types|COMPLETE|
|Tools|COMPLETE|
|Exam readiness|HIGH|
