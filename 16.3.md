|---|
|Attacker creates fake AP|
|Uses same SSID|
|Stronger signal|
|Victim connects|

---

### GOAL

|Goal|
|---|
|Credential harvesting|
|MITM|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Evil Twin = fake AP**

---

## DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK

---

### DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|

---

### PURPOSE

|Purpose|
|---|
|Force reconnection|
|Capture handshakes|
|Enable Evil Twin|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Deauth = kick users off**

---

## DISASSOCIATION ATTACK

---

### DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Disassociation Attack|Forces clients to disconnect from AP|

---

### DIFFERENCE FROM DEAUTH

|Attack|Key Difference|
|---|---|
|Deauth|Authentication termination|
|Disassociation|Association termination|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Deauth ≠ Disassoc**

---

## MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE (MITM)

---

### DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|MITM|Attacker intercepts communication between client and AP|

---

### METHODS

|Method|
|---|
|Evil Twin|
|Rogue AP|
|ARP spoofing|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**MITM = attacker in between**

---

## REPLAY ATTACK

---

### DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Replay Attack|Reusing captured packets to gain access|

---

### COMMONLY TARGETS

|Target|
|---|
|WEP networks|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Replay = reuse packets**

---

## WEP CRACKING ATTACK

---

### PURPOSE

|Purpose|
|---|
|Recover WEP key|

---

### METHOD

|Method|
|---|
|Capture IVs|
|Analyze patterns|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**More IVs = faster crack**

---

## KRACK ATTACK

---

### DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|KRACK|Key Reinstallation Attack|

---

### TARGET

|Target|
|---|
|WPA2|

---

### IMPACT

|Impact|
|---|
|Decrypt traffic|
|Replay packets|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**KRACK breaks handshake**

---

## PACKET INJECTION ATTACK

---

### DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Packet Injection|Injecting crafted packets into wireless network|

---

### PURPOSE

|Purpose|
|---|
|Speed up WEP cracking|
|Disrupt traffic|

---

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Inject = fake packets**

---

## JAMMING ATTACK

---

### DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Jamming|Flooding wireless spectrum with noise|

---

### RESULT

|Result|
|---|
|Denial of Service|

---

MEMORY HOOK:
