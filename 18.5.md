# OBJECTIVE 05 — IoT AND OT SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES

---

## WHY COUNTERMEASURES ARE CRITICAL (EXAM LOGIC)

|Reason|
|---|
|IoT and OT devices control critical infrastructure|
|Exploitation can cause physical damage|
|Devices are difficult to patch|
|Long operational lifecycles|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Weak security = real-world harm**

---

# IOT SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES

---

## DEVICE-LEVEL COUNTERMEASURES

|Countermeasure|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Disable unused interfaces|Turn off JTAG, UART, debug ports|
|Secure boot|Ensure only trusted firmware loads|
|Hardware root of trust|Cryptographic verification at boot|
|Tamper detection|Detect physical access attempts|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**No debug ports in production**

---

## FIRMWARE-LEVEL COUNTERMEASURES

|Countermeasure|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Firmware signing|Prevent unauthorized firmware|
|Encrypted firmware|Protect sensitive code|
|Secure OTA updates|Authenticate update source|
|Remove hardcoded credentials|Prevent reuse attacks|

EXAM TRAP:  
Firmware encryption alone is NOT sufficient without signing.

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Signed + encrypted firmware**

---

## AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL

|Measure|
|---|
|Strong passwords|
|Certificate-based authentication|
|Role-based access control (RBAC)|
|Least privilege|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Every device must authenticate**

---

## NETWORK-LEVEL IOT SECURITY

---

### SEGMENTATION (VERY IMPORTANT)

|Measure|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Network segmentation|Isolate IoT devices|
|VLANs|Logical separation|
|Firewalls|Restrict access|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**IoT never flat network**

---

### PROTOCOL HARDENING

|Protocol|Countermeasure|
|---|---|
|MQTT|Enable authentication & TLS|
|CoAP|DTLS|
|HTTP|HTTPS|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Plaintext protocols are unsafe**

---

## MONITORING & LOGGING

|Measure|
|---|
|Intrusion detection|
|Anomaly detection|
|Centralized logging|

---

# OT SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES

---

## ARCHITECTURAL CONTROLS (EXAM FAVORITE)

---

### ZONE AND CONDUIT MODEL (IEC 62443)

|Component|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Zones|Group assets with same risk|
|Conduits|Controlled communication paths|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Zones isolate, conduits control**

---

## NETWORK SEGMENTATION IN OT

|Layer|Rule|
|---|---|
|IT|Internet-facing|
|DMZ|Buffer zone|
|OT|Isolated|

EXAM TRAP:  
Direct IT-to-OT communication is insecure.

---

## ACCESS CONTROL IN OT

|Control|
|---|
|Strong authentication|
|Multi-factor authentication|
|Role separation|
|Logging of access|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Operators ≠ administrators**

---

## PROTOCOL SECURITY IN OT

|Protocol|Countermeasure|
|---|---|
|Modbus|Secure gateways|
|DNP3|Secure authentication|
|BACnet|Network isolation|

EXAM TRAP:  
Most OT protocols lack native security.

---

## PATCHING & CHANGE MANAGEMENT

|Practice|
|---|
|Test patches offline|
|Schedule maintenance windows|
|Vendor-approved updates|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Patch carefully, not frequently**

---

## MONITORING & INCIDENT RESPONSE

|Measure|
|---|
|Passive monitoring|
|Anomaly detection|
|Incident response plans|

---

# PHYSICAL SECURITY (IOT + OT)

| Measure              |     |
| -------------------- | --- |
| Locked cabinets      |     |
| Surveillance         |     |
| Access logs          |     |
| Tamper-evident seals |     |

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Physical access = full compromise**

---

# CLOUD & BACKEND SECURITY (IOT)

|Measure|
|---|
|API authentication|
|Token expiration|
|Secure cloud configuration|
|Regular audits|

---

# SECURITY STANDARDS & FRAMEWORKS (EXAM)

|Standard|Purpose|
|---|---|
|IEC 62443|OT security|
|NIST SP 800-82|ICS security|
|OWASP IoT Top 10|IoT risks|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**62443 = OT bible**

---

# COMMON DEFENSIVE TOOLS (EXAM)

|Tool|
|---|
|IDS/IPS|
|SIEM|
|Firewalls|
|Network monitoring tools|

---

# EXAM TRAPS (VERY IMPORTANT)

|Trap|Correct Understanding|
|---|---|
|Encryption alone is enough|False|
|OT can be patched like IT|False|
|Flat networks are acceptable|False|
|Safety > security means ignore security|False|

---

# OBJECTIVE 05 — EXAM MEMORY BLOCK

**IoT and OT security requires layered defenses.  
Disable debug interfaces, secure firmware, and enforce authentication.  
Segment networks using zones and conduits.  
Most OT protocols are insecure by default.  
Security controls must not disrupt operations.**
