# OBJECTIVE 04 — MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT (MDM)

---

## MDM — CORE DEFINITION (EXAM)

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Mobile Device Management (MDM)|A security solution used to monitor, manage, and secure mobile devices deployed across organizations|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**MDM = control + policy + enforcement**

---

## WHY MDM IS REQUIRED (EXAM CONTEXT)

|Reason|
|---|
|BYOD environments|
|Data leakage prevention|
|Centralized control|
|Compliance enforcement|
|Device loss or theft|

---

## MDM — PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (MUST MEMORIZE)

|Objective|
|---|
|Secure corporate data|
|Enforce security policies|
|Control device access|
|Monitor device activity|
|Enable remote actions|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Secure, Enforce, Control, Monitor, Respond**

---

# MDM ARCHITECTURE (EXAM)

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|MDM Server|Central management console|
|MDM Agent|Installed on device|
|Policy Engine|Enforces rules|
|Communication Channel|Secure device-server link|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Server → Agent → Policy**

---

## MDM DEPLOYMENT MODELS (EXAM)

|Model|Description|
|---|---|
|On-Premises|Hosted internally|
|Cloud-Based|Hosted by vendor|
|Hybrid|Combination|

---

# MDM FUNCTIONALITIES (HIGH-YIELD TABLE)

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Device enrollment|Registers device|
|Policy enforcement|Passwords, encryption|
|App management|Whitelisting/blacklisting|
|Content control|Data access rules|
|Remote wipe|Erases data|
|Remote lock|Locks device|
|Location tracking|GPS-based|
|Compliance monitoring|Policy violations|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Enroll → Control → Enforce → Wipe**

---

# SECURITY POLICIES ENFORCED BY MDM

|Policy|
|---|
|Password complexity|
|Screen lock timeout|
|Encryption enforcement|
|Jailbreak/root detection|
|App restrictions|
|Network usage control|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Password, Encrypt, Detect, Restrict**

---

## MDM — APP MANAGEMENT (EXAM)

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|App whitelisting|Allow approved apps|
|App blacklisting|Block risky apps|
|App containerization|Isolate corporate apps|
|App updates|Forced updates|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Whitelist beats blacklist**

---

# CONTAINERIZATION (EXAM FAVORITE)

## CONTAINERIZATION — DEFINITION

|Item|Memorize|
|---|---|
|Containerization|Isolating corporate data and apps from personal data on a device|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Work separated from personal**

---

## BENEFITS OF CONTAINERIZATION

|Benefit|
|---|
|Data isolation|
|Selective wipe|
|Privacy preservation|
|BYOD-friendly|

---

# REMOTE ACTIONS VIA MDM (EXAM)

|Action|
|---|
|Remote wipe|
|Selective wipe|
|Device lock|
|Password reset|
|Factory reset|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Lost device = wipe**

---

# MDM SECURITY LIMITATIONS (EXAM TRAP)

|Limitation|
|---|
|Cannot stop zero-day exploits|
|Rooted/jailbroken devices bypass controls|
|Depends on user compliance|
|Limited against social engineering|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**MDM ≠ invincible**

---

# MDM ATTACK SURFACE (IMPORTANT)

|Attack|
|---|
|Agent tampering|
|Policy bypass|
|Jailbreak evasion|
|Malicious profiles|
|Certificate abuse|

---

# COMMON MDM SOLUTIONS (CEH EXPECTS RECOGNITION)

|Tool|
|---|
|Microsoft Intune|
|VMware Workspace ONE|
|IBM MaaS360|
|MobileIron|
|Cisco Meraki MDM|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Intune = Microsoft**

---

# MDM VS EMM VS UEM (EXAM COMPARISON)

|Term|Scope|
|---|---|
|MDM|Device management|
|EMM|Device + apps + content|
|UEM|Unified endpoint management|

MEMORY HOOK:  
**MDM ⊂ EMM ⊂ UEM**

---

# OBJECTIVE 04 — EXAM MEMORY BLOCK

**MDM provides centralized control over mobile devices.  
It enforces security policies, manages apps, and enables remote actions.  
Containerization separates corporate and personal data.  
MDM improves security but does not eliminate all risks.**
