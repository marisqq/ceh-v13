# HOW IoT WORKS (STEP FLOW — MUST MEMORIZE)

1. Sensors collect data from environment
    
2. Data sent to gateway
    
3. Gateway forwards data to cloud
    
4. Data is processed and analyzed
    
5. User accesses data via remote application
    
6. Actions/alerts triggered if conditions met
    

MEMORY HOOK:  
**Sense → Send → Store → Analyze → Act**

# OBJECTIVE 01 — EXAM MEMORY BLOCK

**IoT connects physical devices using sensors, gateways, and cloud services.  
It uses layered architecture, lightweight protocols, and diverse communication technologies.  
Security is weak due to default credentials, limited resources, and poor patching.  
Multiple communication models exist, each with unique risks.**
