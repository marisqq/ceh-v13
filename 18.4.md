# OBJECTIVE 04 — EXAM MEMORY BLOCK

**OT systems control physical processes and prioritize availability and safety.  
They use PLCs, RTUs, HMIs, and SCADA systems.  
Legacy protocols lack authentication and encryption.  
Attacks can cause real-world physical damage.  
Stuxnet proved cyber attacks can destroy infrastructure.**
